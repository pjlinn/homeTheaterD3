This is the source code for the Scholarly Paper Systems Engineering Design and Tradeoff Analysis with Web Technology. In order to run, the code requires a server to be running on your local machine. Fortunately, the source code comes with a webserver.

To run the serve you must have Node (http://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

Once Node is installed, cd into the homeTheaterD3 directory and type in the following command to start the server:
	$./scripts/web-server.js

If this is successful, a message that looks like: 

 > Http Server running at http://localhost:8001/

will show up on the terminal.

To get to the web application, open a browser and navigate to:
	http://localhost:8001/index.html
